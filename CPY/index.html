			<div id="text">The last couple of months have been a truly transformative experience. I noticed changes in my body, my feelings, and my outlook on various matters. Not unexpectedly, yoga helped me treat myself, and others, better. I am also blessed to have been surrounded by a group of inspiring yogis, who I hope to see more of, and wish them all the best in their future yoga teaching endavors. <br><br> To all the teachers - Andrea, Jen, Kayla, Sasha - you have served as an inspiration and support throughout this process, and I thank you for all the hard work you put into assisting me in my yoga journey. <br><br>
			Namaste y'all!
