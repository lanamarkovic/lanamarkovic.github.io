			<div id="text">Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice or discipline. I, like most people in the western world today, started practicing yoga because of its physical benefits. It took a couple of years and a few teachers to make me realize that yoga can be much more.
			Once I realized that, I started using it as a vent space, an escape from the state of mind I was in at that particular moment. It helped me calm down after a tough day at work and made it easier to handle heartbreaks and other disappointing experiences. My appreciation for the practice grew and after a while I couldn't imagine a week without yoga. I would be extremely disappointed when my favorite yoga teacher couldn't teach a scheduled class or if I had to skip it.
			After a while I learned that teachers come and go and that I have to focus on the internal understanding of yoga: it is not only about how someone presents it to me, but also about how I present it to myself.
			A few years of regular practice made yoga much more than a way to stay in shape; now it is an outstanding way to find peace and sense in my life and stay grounded. Through this site I will aim to bring the essence and benefits of yoga closer to others.
